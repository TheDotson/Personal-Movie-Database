# Personal Movie Database (PMDB)

If you're a movie collector such as myself, then you too have known the frustration of seeing a movie (especially if it's on sale) and failing to recall whether or not you already own it.  That is the reason I created the Personal Movie Database (PMDB) as my Front End Capstone project.

The purpose of this App is to allow a user to catalogue their movie collection into an easily referenceable collection they can access from anywhere.
